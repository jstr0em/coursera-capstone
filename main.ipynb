    "## Introduction / Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of this model is the predict the severity of a potential road accident (a binary measurement in this case). This is to attempt to avoid the possibility of being stuck in traffic induced by a severe accident (denoted as 2, whereas a less severe accident is denoted as 1). The severity of an accident will be predicted based on the road and light conditions at a given point in time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Audience / Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of model is useful for anyone seeking to plan a trip and wish to avoid being stuck in traffic due to accidents. Perhaps it is especially useful for those who value avoiding wasting their time in traffic, and have the ability to plan their travelling. E.g., delivery drivers may not benefit as much for this model as, for instance, people travelling for leisure/vacation, as the former are often on a schedule outside of their control and may therefore be forced to travel irrespective of what the model suggests. However, the model can be used to plan deliveries (and the like) more carefully, and reduction of leuisarly drivers during more accident prone times will still benefit those with less choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Limitations of Model\n",
    "\n",
    "While the data used to create the model is based on traffic accident data in Seattle, it is likely that the model is generalizable to situations outside of Seattle as well. However, this predictive ability likely decreases as the predicted area becomes more different from Seattle. For instance, Seattle is located in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, and the model will likely perform best for areas that has similar driving laws/cultures and climate as Seattle does. Thus, this model is most useful to stakeholders travelling through areas of this type. \n"

    "The data encompasses traffic accident data recorded in the Seattle area. There are 37 different features and 1 target variable in the dateset. These features contain some irrelevant data (at least for prediction purposes) such as report numbers and object IDs, that simply will not be used. \n",
    " \n",
    "There is also detailed data of how each crash occurred, such as which lane segment, if the accident occurred in an intersection, on a block or something similar. These details are likewise not very interesting as travelling through intersections, changing lanes, and passing by city blocks is an intrinsic part of travel and cannot be avoided. Other irrelevant data is if the accident occurred while the driver was under the influence or he/she was speeding. It should go without saying that this should not be done while driving and is thus unnecessary data. \n",
    " \n",
    "Furthermore, there is a lot of data that is not independent from other variables. For instance, weather conditions contain less information than road and light conditions (ROADCOND and LIGHTCOND respectively) and such we don't need to consider weather. Likewise, the number of pedestrians or vehicles involved in a crash are assumed to be built into the severity of the accident. \n",
    " \n",
    "For these reasons, we will only use ROADCOND and LIGHTCOND for our model. These features are categorical, as is the target variables, and some supervised classification algorithm is ideal. "
